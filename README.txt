Requirements:
You need to develop a software for the International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) of Harvard University.
They need to store student information, such as:
Name, ID, Telephone Number, US Address and Address where they live in their own country.
Plus, the kind of Visa they have, the period of time they can stay in US, and what is allowed them to do with such Visa.
You need to consider these kind of Visa:
F: student Visa, it allows to follow courses, IF and only IF the student is paying the fees.
J: professor Visa, it allows to work as faculty member for the University
H: professional Visa, it allows to work as intern for the University

They need to use these functionality:
Add/remove a person.
Check, in case a F Visa student wants to follow a course,  if he/she paid all the fees.
Check, in case a J Visa Professor wants to teach a course,
 if the expiration date of the Visa is after the end (or start) of the course.
 Plus, it needs to check if the Professor is teaching more than 15 units,
 and, if s/he is, the system should prevent him/her to teach the new course.
